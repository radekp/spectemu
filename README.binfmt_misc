Do you want to directly execute your .z80 snapshots like this:
chmod 755 foo.z80
./foo.z80

Well, get the Linux kernel 2.2.x or 2.0.x-SuSE, compile it with misc
binary format. Also say Y to the sysctl support if using 2.2.x.

Put the following lines into your boot scripts:

insmod binfmt_misc   # only if you compiled binfmt_misc as module
echo ':z80:E::z80::/usr/local/bin/spectemu:' \
    >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

Boot the new kernel and enjoy spectemu :)
