In case you wonder who wrote this, well I did. I started it when I worked
for Philips (Electronics Company). Our plant was taken over by Digital 
(Computer Company) so then I was all of a sudden a Digital employe (sorry,
it didn't help much for my English I'm afraid). Now I found a new job myself,
so now, I now work for Ericsson (Telecom Company). Now Ericsson is Swedish
so you can guess what will happen to my English now (ever seen the
Swedish cook on the Muppets show... :-) :-) ).

Neither Philips nor Digital nor Ericsson have anything to do with this
software (the don't even know it exists!), complain to me if you have
problems. Note that I can not be forced to do anything about it, so you
are just lucky if I will make updates. You can of course modify it yourself,
it's not illegal because I made it Public Domain. This means nobody owns it
and you can do with it as you see fit. This also means that nobody can be
blamed for screwing up your system, not even me! So if you think I hid a
nasty HD-formating program in this software than don't use it!

If you change something that might be usefull for others please tell me! I may
include it in future versions. 

If you help me in any way than I will put your name in the docs as a reward -
unless you don't want it of course!

------------- SKIP the next section if you don't know about PGP -------------
You can always check if the binary is from me using spconv.sig. You need PGP
(Pretty Good Privacy version 2 or better) for this, type:
                     'pgp spconv.sig spconv.exe'. 
You'll need a trusted public key from me, I have included my public key here
but you need a independent key to be sure that I am who I appear to be. You
can get my key from various PGP key-servers - info about this is is packed
with pgp, pgpshell and pgpfront. If you use PGP you'll probably know about
this already. You can also send me a message using this key, I can tell you
if this is my key - not secure but better than nothing. By the way I used
PGP2.6.i to create these keys.
--------- END of SKIP the next section if you don't know about PGP ----------

Please don't ask me to make the converter work for .TAP files, I will not
because you need an emulator for that. The Shareware Z80-201.zip or newer
will convert .TAP files to .Z80 for you, you can take if from there with
this converter to any of the other formats.

If you want to E-mail me, my current address is:

	Henk de Groot, hegr@ensae.ericsson.se

If you want to mail me privately use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy from Phil
Zimmermann) if it contains material for me only (like snapshots or a message
for verification of the public key so you can check spconv.exe with
spconv.sig)

My public PGP key:

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.i

				Good luck with this software!
