Spconv can now convert .SNX files. These are the eXtended SNApshot files used
by one of the Atari ST Spectrum emulators. They contain a header very similar
to the SNA format, but use RLE compression on the (48K only) RAM image to
obtain a smaller file, much like .Z80 files.

Please note: this is not a version released by Henk, but by me, Damien Burke
(D.M.Burke-CSSE94@cs.bham.ac.uk or CCS4DMB1@ibm3090.bham.ac.uk). If you have
any problems converting to/from .SNX format, don't complain to Henk, complain
to me!

Release number of spconv updated from 1.08 to 1.09.

Spconv can now convert .Z80 files of 3.0 format. Spconv should have warned
the user that the .Z80 file had a new format but instead the test failed due
to a mistake from me (aka bug). Spconv proceeded as if it was a .Z80 2.01
file. Due to miss-alignment warnings about unhandled and illegal memory
banks were given instead.

I changed the test. I also made the code dynamic so it will issue a warning
about a new .Z80 format but will attempt to convert it anyway. If Gerton
sticks to the current scheme it should work in the future (but you have to
live with the warning though, unless you patch it out yourself :-) ).

Other changes:
- I should have removed #include <malloc.h> in the cleanup action of 1.07,
  I forgot it and GCC in pedantic setting gave a warning. I corrected this
  very important bug :-)

This version has a better conversion to .ACH files. Help was given by a sample
.sna to .ach converter program and an archimedes snapshot snapped just after
startup.

Other changes:
- Cleanup of code. Make it gcc-pedantic mode proof (thanks Chris Wells).
- Inclusion of UNIX make-file (thanks to Chris Wells again).
- Inclusion of UNIX style man page (thanks to (guess who...) Chris Wells!).
- Make definition of exit-codes clear and consistent.
- Add some more comments in the code.
- Replace "sizeof" operator by #defines - needed for some environments
- Tell about the exit-codes in the documentation.
- Rearrange the doc file.

This version will cope with .Z80 files written by Z80-201. The .Z80 format was
changed to enable its use for 128K snapshots. Spconv will be able to read
and convert this format. The output .Z80 files are in the old format so they
can be read by old and new Z80 emulator versions. You can use Spconv also
to convert the new-style .Z80 files to the old style so you can use it with
your old (probably registered) version of Z80. Spconv will check if the
input .Z80 file is for a 48K Spectrum.

The code is a little bit reorganized. The number of "if, else if, else if..."
began to look rediculous - as if I never heard from 'switch/case'. Well I have
and I changed it now. The new .Z80 format forced me to execute read system
calls with a low number of bytes. They started to get expensive so I changed
everything to <stdio.h> file I/O. The Z80 uncompress routine should be
faster now because I don't need an intermediate buffer anymore. I still need
one for compression so I can output an uncompressed image if the compression
actualy expands the file... Maybe I'll change that too in the future and take
expansion of worst-case files (files with a lot of '0xed,0xed,0x00' sequences)
for granted.

Now I hope I didn't break anything...

This is a maintenance version. The conversion to/from .zx files should be much
better now thanks to info from Peter McGavin. The code is cleaned up, at some
places Intel byte-ordering was assumed. Also the use of 'far' pointers are
moved into #ifdef __TURBOC__ conditions, compiling under UNIX should not be
bothered by it anymore. All functions have prototypes and similar functions
are grouped together. The snapshot structures and prototypes are moved to
a .h file. Turbo-C++ 1.0 in it's most pedantic mode produces no warnings
anymore. I did not split-up the spconv.c file further, I should because its
growing to big already but I like building it without needing a Turbo-C
project file for Turbo-C's IDE environment.

This version can also convert to/from .zx files. These files are used in the
KGB emulator for the amiga computer. It's not fool proof, some registers are
not found in the KGB snapshot.

Release number of spconv updated from 1.03 to 1.04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release date: 26 february 1993
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version can also convert to/from .ach files. These files are used in an
emulator for the archimedes computer. Normaly the files are .arc files but
the extension .arc is already used for ARC archives so I used .ach instead.

Release number of spconv updated from 1.02 to 1.03
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release date: 14 december 1992
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version can also convert to/from .prg files. These files are used in an
Irish emulator. While building it, some ideas came up to enhance the converion
to/from .SP files (recognition of IM2).

Upgraded call of the program, the program can now take only a suffix as second
agrument, the prefix for the first argument is used. This enables easy mass
conversion by using a batchfile with a command like:

	'for %%i in (*.z80) do spconv %%i .sna'

If wildcards are given at the commandline a error is generated.

Error discoved in the way IFF was handled for Z80. This bug prevented correct
conversion of some programs from .SNA to .Z80.

Release number of spconv updated from 1.0 to 1.01
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release date: 10 august 1992
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The new SPCONV has a big bug. It will not convert compressed .Z80 files
correctly. The program uses JPP format internaly. For JPP the program
counter is on the stack. The converter stored the PC in the image
*BEFORE* it was de-compressed. This resulted in corrupting other image data.
(Converting TO .Z80 works fine).

Due to errors I am planning to keep versions more carefully. From now on
SPCONV has a release number and a generation date. This will show up if
you run SPCONV without arguments.

Release date: 5 august 1992

SPCONV : Now handles .Z80 files and new format of .SP. Old format still
	 supported.

Bug fixes:

General: Clear compilation of all programs under Turbo-C 2.0

Documentation up to date.

Initial program to convert between .SNA .SP and RAW. No more history.
