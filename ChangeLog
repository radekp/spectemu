98/05/14 Version 0.93.4 released
--------------------------------

98/05/14  Small additions:
	  - Keyboard matrix is emulated (only 1 level, I hope this is enough)

	    are now working. No custom keyboard or joystick yet
	  - Small modifications to make z80 emulation separate

98/04/30  Version 0.93.2 released
---------------------------------

98/04/30  I've removed the BROKEN_VGAKEYBOARD part from vgakey.c. 
	  I hope nobody's using SVGALIB version smaller than 1.2.11.

98/04/29  Some small new features: (see example.cfg for a complete list)
	  - different icon when the emulator is paused
	  - optional private colormap
	  - configurable colours (grayscale looks better on
	    monochrome displays)
	  - filetype can be given on the command line (tapefiles too)
	  - optional immediate loading of tapes (-load-immed)
	
98/04/27  Added configurability to spectemu:
	  - global config file (($prefix)/share/spectemu/spectemu.cfg)
	  - user's config file (~/.spectemurc)
	  - X resource database
	  - command line
	
98/04/23  Mode 320x240 is used in vgaspect (if available)

---------------------------------

98/04/19  Added Spectrum keyboard picture, which shows pressed keys, and
	  keys can be pressed with mouse.
98/04/16  Rewrite keyboard handling:
	  - Fixes keyboard bug in X (key remained pressed)
	  - Better configurability: spectrum key definitions are in spkey.c
	    instead of xkey.c and vgakey.c

98/04/07  Added readline support by Christian Sievers <sievers@cip.rz.tu-bs.de>

98/03/24  Version 0.92 released

98/03/19  Implement LOOP/CALL/RETURN blocks in TZX handling
98/03/17  Fixed (hopefully all) bugs in TZX handling:
 	  - There must be a 1ms pause at end of tape.
	  - Pausing after data blocks fixed.
	  - Made tape I/O timing ultra precise (e.g. see Flashpoint)
	
98/03/14  Fixed small bug in quick load

98/03/08  C-version now handles bits 3 and 5 of the Flag register
	  (I hope I didn't break anything with this).
98/03/08  Wrote 'tapeout' utility to save tapefiles to real tape (via 
	  soundcard).

98/03/06  Implemented emulator pause.
98/03/06  Added ability to display spectrum keyboard layout on text 
	  console (Radovan.Garabik@fmph.uniba.sk).

98/03/05  Rewrite of snapshot handeling:
          - All versions of Z80 snapshots can now be loaded.
	  - Loading and saving of SNA snapshot format is supported. 
	  - Quick loading and saving of temporary snapshot.
	
98/03/03  Rewrite of tapefile handeling:
	  - Support for most TZX blocks (recognise length of all v1.11
	    blocks)
	  - SPT tapefiles are no longer supported 
          - Added quick loading of tapefiles
	  - Timing in tape emulation is very exact now, but this makes 
	    tape sound ugly (this will be fixed).
